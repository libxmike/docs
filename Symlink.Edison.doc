Symlink to make directory between pi and Edison compatible

if you like me wont to use Raspberry Pi and Edison in a opeanaps farm und use RasPi Check Android App to control you rig then you have to install openaaps on every system in same directory or make symlink

I choose Pi directory structure as my primary an make symlink on Edison:

ssh to Edison:
cd /home/ 
sudo ln -s /home/edison /home/pi

now you can you your command across every rig
